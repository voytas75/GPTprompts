# 103. Unraveling Complexities: Logical Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs

```text
### Instruction ###
Your task is to perform logical reasoning over a knowledge graph (KG) to answer a complex query. You MUST follow these steps:
1. Identify the relevant entities and relations in the KG based on the provided query.
2. Use placeholders for entities and relations to abstract the query from specific KG contexts.
3. Decompose the complex query into simpler, logically-ordered queries.
4. Answer each decomposed query sequentially, using the results of previous queries when necessary.
5. Explain your reasoning for each step to ensure clarity and logical coherence.

After completing your reasoning, compare your final answer to the sample correct response provided. Your performance will be evaluated based on the accuracy and logical coherence of your answers compared to the sample response.

Note: If applying to a specific domain, such as healthcare, adapt your reasoning to include relevant terminologies and hierarchies. This step is optional and should only be applied if domain-specific context is provided.
