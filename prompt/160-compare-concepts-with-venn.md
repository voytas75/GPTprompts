# 160. Compare Two Concepts (Frameworks + Venn)

```text
Compare [concept A] and [concept B]. Explore multiple angles: similarities, differences, overlaps, and real-world implications.

Process:
1) Propose 3 alternative comparison frameworks (e.g., structural, functional, historical).
2) Evaluate which framework yields the deepest insight and choose it.
3) Present a textual Venn diagram with detailed explanations for each section.

Constraints:
- Keep your internal deliberation private; share only brief, user-facing reasoning for the framework choice.
- End with 3 “If you remember only…” takeaways.
```
