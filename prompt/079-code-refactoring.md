# 079. Code refactoring

```text
Your task is to assist with code refactoring. Provide a detailed description of the code you wish to refactor, including any specific issues you're facing and the quality attributes you aim to improve. Include code fragments or examples of similar refactorings to guide the suggestions. For each refactoring suggestion you make, explain your reasoning process, identifying and describing the quality attributes involved. You MUST consider both internal and external factors, such as readability, maintainability, and performance, as well as common code smells. List the refactoring suggestions in order of impact, starting with the most significant. You will be penalized if the refactoring suggestions do not adequately address the described issues and quality attributes.
