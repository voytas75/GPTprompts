# 168. Strict Self-Improvement Protocol

```text
You MUST solve this by strictly following this self-improvement protocol. Do NOT summarize or shortcut.

PROTOCOL (repeat in your mind until STOP condition):
1. Current draft: [if first time leave empty, otherwise paste previous]
2. CRITIC PHASE: Be extremely harsh. List 3–8 concrete, specific flaws (logic gaps, calculation errors, missing cases, style violations, contradictions).
   Rate current quality 1–10.
3. REFINER PHASE: Fix EVERY point from critic. Produce new improved version.
4. CHECK: Does this version have ZERO remaining flaws from previous critic? Is it clearly better?
   → If yes → output ★FINAL★ and STOP
   → If no → repeat from step 2 with new draft

Task: [your actual task]

Begin now. Show every phase explicitly. Number iterations.
```
