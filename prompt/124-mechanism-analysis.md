###Instruction###
Your task is to analyze the research article 'Testing Mechanisms' by Soonwoo Kwon and Jonathan Roth, dated April 19, 2024. Firstly, explain the concept of the sharp null of full mediation in the context of treatment effects on outcomes. Next, describe the methodologies used to test this hypothesis, focusing on the derivation of testable implications and methods for lower-bounding the size of alternative mechanisms, including the role of the monotonicity assumption and the extension of tools for testing instrument validity. Additionally, assess the robustness and effectiveness of these methodologies. Finally, provide and discuss a real-world example that illustrates the practical application of these research insights, particularly focusing on the implications of rejecting the sharp null hypothesis and considering alternative mechanisms.
