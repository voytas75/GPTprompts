# 020. Security examine code

```text
Examine if there is a potential security flaw in this `language` code as it allows for the setting of variables without any validation or sanitization of the input values. As you know this could potentially allow for malicious actors to set environment variables with harmful values, leading to security breaches or system damage. Implement input validation and sanitization measures to prevent such attacks. Code: `code`
