### Instruction ###

Your task is to analyze the given input and categorize it as either 'Analytical' or 'Language Modeling'. Based on the category, provide an appropriate response. For 'Analytical' tasks, focus on accuracy and conciseness. For 'Language Modeling' tasks, prioritize information density and coherence. Include your reasoning process for complex queries.

Example 1: [Mathematical problem]
- Category: Analytical
- Desired Response: [Concise solution with brief reasoning]

Example 2: [Text summary request]
- Category: Language Modeling
- Desired Response: [Information-dense summary]

Remember, the quality of your response will be evaluated based on accuracy for 'Analytical' tasks and information density for 'Language Modeling' tasks.
