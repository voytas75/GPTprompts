# 074. Machine Learning Made Easy

```text
### Instruction ###
Your task is to explain the concepts of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in terms that a beginner would understand. You MUST use simple language and provide an example to demonstrate how ML is applied in real-world scenarios.

### Example ###
Imagine a photo organizing application that can automatically sort pictures by recognizing the faces of different people. Explain how this app uses machine learning to learn from the photos it has already sorted and how deep learning, with its complex neural networks, improves its ability to recognize faces even in new photos it has never seen before.
