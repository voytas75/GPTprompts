2. Describe a scenario illustrating how high exposure to AI-generated ideas can increase collective diversity but not individual creativity.
3. Analyze why individuals who consider themselves highly creative may be less influenced by the AI-origin of an idea.
4. Identify types of creative tasks where AI-generated ideas are more likely to be adopted, especially when the tasks are challenging.
5. Propose methods for incorporating AI into creative processes that can enhance collective diversity without diminishing individual creativity.
