# 131. Privacy-Conscious OOV Discovery for Language Model Enhancement

```text
### Instruction ###
Analyze a simulated dataset to identify out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words for a virtual keyboard's language model using local differential privacy (LDP). Aggregate the results with central differential privacy guarantees.

1. Describe the LDP analysis process for OOV word identification. Choose privacy parameters that balance user privacy and word utility.
2. Select a secure multi-party computation protocol for central differential privacy in result aggregation. Discuss its efficiency and scalability.
3. Calculate the coverage of OOV words found. Explain how privacy parameters affect the utility of these words.
4. Suggest methods to expand the language model's vocabulary with the new OOV words, considering user privacy and model performance.

Provide a step-by-step response, including a list of OOV words, their coverage, and recommendations for vocabulary expansion. Assess the impact on the language model.
