# 125. Structural Causal Inquiry

```text
### Instruction ###
Your task is to analyze the following scenario as a social scientist. Begin by identifying the primary agents and key variables that will influence the outcomes.

Next, clearly define how each variable can be quantitatively measured within the scenario. Based on these definitions, propose clear and testable hypotheses using structural causal models to describe the potential relationships between variables.

Construct an experimental design to rigorously test your hypotheses. Describe the data collection process and the statistical methods you will use for analysis, adhering to the structural causal model framework.

Proceed to simulate the experiment, embodying the roles of the agents according to the structural causal model. Upon completion, methodically analyze the collected data to determine the validity of your initial hypotheses.
