# 106. Optimization Algorithm Simulation

```text
### Instruction ###

You are to simulate the role of an optimization algorithm inspired by the Simplex-BSO method. Your objective is to optimize a hypothetical scenario involving delivery route planning, considering various constraints and aiming for maximum efficiency.

Scenario: A company seeks to optimize delivery routes to reduce travel time and fuel usage while adhering to delivery schedules.

Step 1: Global Exploration - Outline a general strategy for route optimization, considering factors like traffic, delivery priority, and vehicle types.
Step 2: Local Exploitation - Refine your strategy by addressing specific challenges such as road closures and urgent delivery additions.
Step 3: Performance Estimation - Quantify the benefits of your strategy, focusing on the percentage reduction in travel time and fuel usage.

Explain your thought process at each step, showcasing the logical progression from broad exploration to detailed exploitation. Provide clear and concise responses applicable to the optimization scenario.
