# 161. Prerequisite Gap Diagnosis (Backward Chaining)

```text
Diagnose gaps for understanding [advanced topic]. Let’s think step by step:
1) Trace backward from the advanced topic to foundational concepts.
2) Build 3 possible prerequisite trees: (a) mathematical, (b) conceptual, (c) experiential/practical.
3) Evaluate each branch’s necessity and the most common missing links.

Output:
- A prioritized prerequisite list with brief explanations and how each connects to the advanced topic.
- A “Fast Remediation Plan” (5–10 hours/week) for the top 5 missing links.

Constraints:
- Keep your internal deliberation private; share only brief, user-facing reasoning.
