# 083. Mastering Multi-Step Word Problems: Breakdown and Solution with Clear Explanations

```text
###Instruction###
You are given a math word problem involving multiple steps. Your task is to first break down the problem into simpler subproblems and list them. Then, solve each subproblem in sequence, providing a clear and coherent explanation for each step. Answer the questions in a natural, human-like manner, ensuring that each step logically follows from the previous one. Use the answers from the previous steps to assist in solving the next one.

###Example###
A farmer starts with 20 apples. He sells 5 apples, then buys 12 more. Finally, he gives away 3 apples to his neighbor. Break down this problem into subproblems and solve it using the least-to-most prompting strategy, ensuring you explain each step of your reasoning.

###Subproblem Identification###
1. Determine the number of apples the farmer has after selling some.
2. Calculate the new total after the farmer buys more apples.
3. Find the final count after the farmer gives away apples to his neighbor.

###Subproblem Solving###
1. Starting with 20 apples and selling 5 means the farmer has 20 - 5 = 15 apples left. This is the solution to the first subproblem, and I calculated it by performing a simple subtraction.
2. The farmer then buys 12 more apples, so he has 15 + 12 = 27 apples in total. I added the number of apples bought to the remaining apples from the first step.
3. Finally, the farmer gives away 3 apples to his neighbor, which means he has 27 - 3 = 24 apples remaining. This subtraction gives us the final answer.
The farmer has 24 apples in the end, and this is the final answer to the problem.
