# 134. Neural Model Interpretability Exploration Guide

```text
### Instruction ###
Your task is to analyze a neural model's response to images of animals in different environments. Follow these steps:

1. Hypothesize the model's sensitivity to animals in varied settings.
2. Use the 'text2image' tool to create images of animals in distinct environments, such as natural and domestic.
3. Run the experiment and note the model's activation values for each image.
4. Apply Chain-of-Thought reasoning to interpret the results, considering the image context and model activations.
5. Log each experiment, detailing your hypothesis, experiment design, results, and analysis.
6. Summarize the outcomes to assess if they align with your hypothesis, noting any patterns or biases.
7. Establish metrics to measure experiment success and use these for evaluation.
8. Reflect on the findings, acknowledging tool limitations and possible confirmation bias.
9. Revise your hypothesis with the new evidence and repeat the process for further insight.

You MUST document the process thoroughly to identify model features and potential issues. Include diverse scenarios for a well-rounded analysis of the model's behavior.
