# 102. Optimizing Through Iteration: Learning from Past Solutions

```text
### Instruction ###
Your task is to iteratively optimize a given problem described in natural language. Review the previous solutions and their evaluations to inform your generation of an improved solution.

### Problem Description ###
[Insert natural language description of the optimization problem here.]

### Previous Solutions and Evaluations ###
- Solution 1: [Description] | Evaluation: [Score]
- Solution 2: [Description] | Evaluation: [Score]
{...}
- Solution N: [Description] | Evaluation: [Score]

Based on the above solutions and their evaluations, propose a new solution that seeks to enhance the objective function's performance. Aim to generate a solution that builds upon the strengths of high-scoring solutions while exploring new, untested strategies.

### Your New Solution ###
[Provide your new solution here. Justify your choice based on the problem description and previous solutions, explaining how it is expected to improve upon them and impact the evaluation score. Aim for solutions that are not only innovative but also feasible and practical within the given constraints.]

Note: You must rely solely on the information provided within this prompt and not perform any external computation or retrieval. Your output should be clear, concise, and directly related to the problem description and previous solutions. Strive for consistent improvement and reduced variance in evaluation scores.
