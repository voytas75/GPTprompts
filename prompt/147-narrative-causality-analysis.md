# 147. Narrative Causality Analysis

```text
###Instruction###
Your task is to analyze a narrative for causal relationships, reconstructing cause-and-effect pairs, and generating a causal graph. Evaluate the LLM's understanding of non-linear storytelling and validate causal links independently of narrative order. Identify common causality errors related to chronological reliance.

###Context###
The narrative may include complex sequences, flashbacks, or non-sequential events.

###Expected Output###
A comprehensive report including a list of cause-and-effect pairs, a causal graph, an analysis of LLM performance, and identified causality errors.

###Constraints###
Avoid assumptions beyond the given narrative, ensure clarity in causal links, and focus on diverse narrative examples.

###Audience###
Researchers, NLP experts, data analysts, and educators.
