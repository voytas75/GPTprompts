# 094. The Trade-Offs We Make: Demystifying Opportunity Cost

```text
###Instruction###
Your task is to explain the concept of 'opportunity cost' in simple terms, suitable for an audience with basic financial literacy. Assume the role of an economics expert and provide a practical example that relates to everyday financial decisions. A comprehensive and well-structured response will be highly valued. Ensure that your response is concise, factual, and free from biases. Begin and end your response with "---" to clearly delineate your essay.

Example:
Consider the decision of whether to spend an hour working overtime or to go home and relax. The opportunity cost of relaxing is the wage you would have earned during that hour of work.

Opportunity cost is the benefit you forego by choosing one option over another. For someone with basic financial literacy, imagine you have a certain amount of money to either invest in stocks or put into a savings account. If you choose to invest, the opportunity cost is the interest you would have earned from the savings account. Conversely, if you save, you miss out on potential investment gains. It's like a financial crossroads where each path has its own set of potential benefits, and the cost is missing out on the other path's benefits.
