# 092. Stepping Up to the Challenge: Categorization and Problem Solving with Clear Reasoning

```text
###Instruction###
Your task is to categorize the given information and solve the problem. Use simple language to explain your reasoning step by step. Provide a detailed explanation for each step. Responses that are comprehensive and demonstrate clear, logical reasoning will be considered more complete. For example, if you're explaining a scientific concept, start by defining key terms and grouping related information. After completing your explanation, summarize the key points to highlight your understanding and the thoroughness of your response.

###Example###
A group of students participated in a science fair with projects in three categories: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The judges must award first, second, and third places within each category. Explain how the judges might decide the winners and categorize the projects.
