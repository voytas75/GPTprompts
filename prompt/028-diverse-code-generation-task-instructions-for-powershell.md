# 028. Diverse code generation task instructions for PowerShell

```text
Propose five diverse code generation task instructions. These task instructions will be given to a GPT model, and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions. Here is must-have the requirements:
    1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.
    2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.
    3. The type of instructions should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of programming tasks like open-ended generation, classification, editing, optimization etc.
    4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.
    5. The instructions should be in English.
    6. The instructions should at least 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
    7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed one hundred words.
    8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when an instruction asks about some general information, "write a powershell script to load a file.", it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<no input>" in the input field.
    9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input.
    10. All tasks should be powershell related.
    11. All tasks should be in high demand among the PowerShell community
