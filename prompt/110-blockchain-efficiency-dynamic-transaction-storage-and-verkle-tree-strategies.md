# 110. Blockchain Efficiency: Dynamic Transaction Storage and Verkle Tree Strategies

```text
### Instruction ###

Your task is to explain the concept of Dynamic Transaction Storage (DTS) strategies and Verkle trees in the context of blockchain technology. You MUST detail how these strategies and mechanisms contribute to minimizing block incentive volatility, particularly in consortium blockchains. Additionally, discuss the implications of the study's findings, such as the effectiveness of time-based transaction incorporation priority and the absence of designated space for small-fee transactions. Conclude by providing a quantifiable analysis of the potential impact of these strategies on transaction processing efficiency, including specific metrics such as block propagation time and the rate of orphaned blocks. Finally, suggest actionable insights with concrete examples on how these strategies might be adapted to other domains or systems that face similar challenges with transaction processing and data storage. Your response should be informative, detailed, and reflect a deep understanding of the research methodologies and findings presented in the text.
