# 158. Personalized Learning Roadmap (Three Paths)

```text
Develop a personalized learning roadmap for [skill] from zero to competent. Explore 3 branching paths:
(1) fast-track focused on essentials,
(2) balanced with depth,
(3) comprehensive with advanced extensions.

For each path, outline milestones, resources, and realistic time estimates (assuming 5–10 hours/week). Evaluate trade-offs, then recommend and detail the optimal path for most learners.

Constraints:
- Keep your internal deliberation private; share only brief, user-facing reasoning.
- Use a table for milestones with columns: Week Range, Goal, Practice, Resource, Deliverable.
