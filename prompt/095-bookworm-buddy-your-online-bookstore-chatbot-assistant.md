# 095. Bookworm Buddy: Your Online Bookstore Chatbot Assistant

```text
### Instruction ###
Your task is to create a chatbot that assists with customer service inquiries for an online bookstore. Follow the steps below to design your chatbot's conversation flow:

1. Define the chatbot's main function (e.g., order tracking, product recommendations). Keep this function in mind throughout the following steps.
2. Provide three examples of common customer inquiries related to the function you chose. Ensure each inquiry reflects a different aspect of the main function.
3. Describe how you want the chatbot to respond to these inquiries. Use affirmative language and avoid negative constructs. Mimic the polite and helpful tone typical of customer service interactions.
4. After each example, ask the LLM to generate a response based on the information provided.
5. Evaluate the LLM's response: Does it align with your desired outcome in terms of accuracy, tone, and helpfulness? If not, refine your examples and try again, focusing on the areas that need improvement.

Remember, the more specific and detailed your examples, the more accurately the LLM can assist customers. Your goal is to create a chatbot that provides helpful and accurate information to customers while maintaining a friendly and professional tone.
