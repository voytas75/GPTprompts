# 157. Misconceptions: Map and Refute

```text
Let’s think step by step. First, brainstorm 5 potential misconceptions about [topic] based on common beginner errors or historical views. For each, describe the typical reasoning path that leads to the misconception (in plain language). Then, select the 3 most prevalent ones. Finally, refute each with a clear, step-by-step counter-argument supported by evidence or logic.

Constraints:
- Keep your internal deliberation private; share only brief, user-facing reasoning.
- For each refutation, include: Claim, Why People Believe It, Why It’s Wrong, Correct View, Quick Check.
