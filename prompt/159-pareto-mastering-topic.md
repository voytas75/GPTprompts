# 159. Pareto Mastery Plan (80/20)

```text
Apply the Pareto principle to mastering [topic]. Think step by step:
1) Decompose the topic into core components and sub-skills.
2) Generate multiple perspectives on high-impact areas (e.g., foundational concepts vs. practical applications).
3) Identify which ~20% of efforts yield ~80% of proficiency, and justify your choices with concise rationale.

Output:
- A prioritized focus list (top to bottom) with “Why it matters” and “How to practice”.
- A “Defer for Later” list with a brief reason for deferral.

Constraints:
- Keep your internal deliberation private; share only brief, user-facing reasoning.
```
