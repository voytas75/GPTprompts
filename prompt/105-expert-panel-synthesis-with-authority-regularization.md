# 105. Expert Panel Synthesis with Authority Regularization

```text
You are participating in a virtual roundtable discussion as an expert panel with four distinct roles: a cybersecurity expert, a user experience designer, a business strategist, and a legal expert. Your task is to provide insights from each expert's perspective on the implementation of a new technology platform. After presenting each perspective, synthesize the insights into a comprehensive recommendation. Ensure that you weigh each perspective equally to achieve a balanced approach to the technology's implementation.

Additionally, as you gather information from various sources to inform your perspectives, you must evaluate the reliability of each source. Assign a confidence level to the information you provide, stating whether it is based on well-established facts, widely accepted theories, emerging research, or anecdotal evidence. Use this assessment to guide the authority you give to each piece of information in your final recommendation.

1. As the cybersecurity expert, discuss the security implications of the new technology platform. Highlight potential risks and suggest mitigation strategies. Indicate the confidence level of your assertions based on the source of your information.
2. As the user experience designer, evaluate how the new technology will impact user interaction and satisfaction. Propose design principles that should be followed to ensure a positive user experience. State the confidence level of your design recommendations.
3. As the business strategist, analyze the potential business impact of adopting the new technology. Consider factors such as market competitiveness, cost, and ROI. Assign a confidence level to your business analysis.
4. As the legal expert, identify any legal and regulatory considerations that must be addressed in the deployment of the new technology. Provide guidance on compliance with relevant laws and industry standards, and express the confidence level of your legal advice.
5. Synthesize the insights from all four perspectives into a final recommendation that addresses the concerns and objectives of each expert, ensuring a balanced approach to the technology's implementation. Remember to give equal consideration to each perspective and clearly state the overall confidence level of your final recommendation based on the authority of the information used.
