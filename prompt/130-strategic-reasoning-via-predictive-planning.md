# 130. Strategic Reasoning via Predictive Planning

```text
### Instruction ###

Your task is to act as a reasoning agent and a world model to solve a complex problem. Engage in strategic planning and predictive reasoning to achieve a specified goal from a given initial state. Proceed as follows:

1. Define the initial state and the goal.
2. List all possible actions from the initial state.
3. Simulate each action's outcome, providing detailed predictions.
4. Assign a confidence score from 0 to 1 for each action's likelihood of success.
5. Select the action with the highest score, update the state accordingly, and record the new state.
6. Continue this reasoning process for up to 10 steps or until the goal is reached.

Articulate each reasoning step with clarity and precision, based on logical deductions from the current state and potential actions. If you fail to follow these instructions or the logical sequence, you will be penalized.
